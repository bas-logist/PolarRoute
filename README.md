PolarRoute is a long-distance maritime polar route planning package, able to take into account complex and changing environmental conditions. It allows the construction of optimised routes through three main stages: discrete modelling of the environmental conditions using a non-uniform mesh, the construction of mesh-optimal paths, and physics informed path smoothing. In order to account for different vehicle properties we construct a series of data-driven functions that can be applied to the environmental mesh to determine the speed limitations and fuel requirements for a given vessel and mesh cell. The environmental modelling component of this functionality is provided by the [MeshiPhi](https://github.com/bas-amop/MeshiPhi) library.

## Installation

PolarRoute is available from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/polar-route/) and the latest version can be installed by running:

```
pip install polar-route
```

Alternatively you can install PolarRoute by downloading the source code from GitHub:
```
git clone https://github.com/bas-amop/PolarRoute
cd PolarRoute
pip install -e .
```

Use of `-e` is optional, based on whether you want to be able to edit the installed copy of the package.

In order to run the test suite you will also need to include the `test` dependency group:

```
pip install --group test
```

> NOTE: Some features of the PolarRoute package require GDAL to be installed. Please consult the [documentation](https://bas-amop.github.io/PolarRoute) for further guidance.

## Usage

PolarRoute operates by creating an environmental mesh, adding vessel performance characteristics, and optimising routes between waypoints. Environmental meshes are created using [MeshiPhi](https://github.com/bas-amop/MeshiPhi), which is installed automatically when installing PolarRoute.

### Quick Start (CLI)

```bash
# Create environmental mesh
create_mesh examples/environment_config/grf_example.config.json -o mesh.json

# Add vessel performance model
add_vehicle examples/vessel_config/SDA.config.json mesh.json -o vessel_mesh.json

# Optimise routes
optimise_routes examples/route_config/traveltime.config.json vessel_mesh.json examples/waypoints_example.csv -o routes.json
```

### Quick Start (Python API)

```python
from meshiphi.mesh_generation.mesh_builder import MeshBuilder
from polar_route.vessel_performance.vessel_performance_modeller import VesselPerformanceModeller
from polar_route.route_planner.route_planner import RoutePlanner

# Create environmental mesh (using MeshiPhi)
mesh_builder = MeshBuilder(env_config)
mesh_json = mesh_builder.build_environmental_mesh().to_json()

# Add vessel performance to mesh
vpm = VesselPerformanceModeller(mesh_json, vessel_config)
vpm.model_accessibility()
vpm.model_performance()
vessel_mesh_json = vpm.to_json()

# Calculate routes
rp = RoutePlanner(vessel_mesh_json, route_config)
rp.compute_routes(waypoints_path)
routes_json = rp.to_json()
```

For more details, see the [CLI documentation](https://bas-amop.github.io/PolarRoute/cli/), [examples](https://bas-amop.github.io/PolarRoute/examples/), and the [examples/](examples/) directory.

## Required Data sources
PolarRoute has been built to work with a variety of open-source atmospheric and oceanographic data sources. For testing and demonstration purposes it is also possible to generate artificial Gaussian Random Field data.

A full list of supported data sources and their associated dataloaders is given in the  'Dataloader Overview' section of the [MeshiPhi manual](https://bas-amop.github.io/MeshiPhi/dataloaders/overview/)
